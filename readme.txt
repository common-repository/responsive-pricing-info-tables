== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display a pricing table on a page or post? =
To display a pricing table on a page or post , just use this shortcode at the place where you want it to be displayed:

Example:

[ rptb_table id = 1295]

If you want to display it in a template, then the PHP way of doing it would be:
`<?php do_shortcode('[rptb_table id=ID]'); ?>`
where ID is the ID of the pricing table

Example:
`<?php do_shortcode('[rptb_table id=1295]'); ?>` 

= How do I display a pricing table on a page or post? =
To display a table group, use the shortcode [rptb_group id = 1295,1262]
where 1295, 1262 etc. are the IDs of the individual tables you want to display in the group.
